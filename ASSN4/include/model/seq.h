     * they are always using 'ISeq', not VectorSeq or something.

     * As far as the method definitions of ISeq stay still, I can write any
     * code that uses note sequence, even without a single implementation.
     *
     * As a TA, this is a good thing because I can write test codes without
     * considering how you implemented details.

     * In real projects, you can prepare multiple implementations for a single
     * abstract class (interface) and use different implementation for
     * different situations
